        <td>Children sometimes think that ‘diets’ are simply for losing weight rather than a description of food we eat regularly. <br />
The ideas of ‘food for growth’ and ‘food for activity’ are simplifications. Children will learn more complex ideas about the functions of different food types at a later stage. Activity may need to be explained to children as related to movement and exercise. <br />

        <td colspan="4">Work in this unit should reinforce and develop children’s knowledge of their personal health and how this relates to diet. <br />
They should learn about how teeth are related to diet and the importance of dental care. <br />
Experimental and investigative work focuses on: <br />
<span style="font-family: Symbol;">· </span>deciding what evidence to collect <br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 3pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">· </span>deciding whether evidence is sufficient to support conclusions. </span><br />
Work also offers opportunities for children to relate understanding of science to their personal health. <br />
This work is likely to be undertaken in relation to the school’s programme for personal, social and health education. <br />
This unit takes approximately 12 hours.<br />
